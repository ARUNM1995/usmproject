Brief Description: This was a POC for User Management System. The main objective of this project is to manage
the userâ€™s information. This application is built on n-layered MVC architecture and has various modules like
registration, login, forgot password and update users information. By using this application, users can be able to
register their details, login and they can update the same once they login. This application also generates a
password and mails it to a registered email by using JavaMails. User can upload the files using this application.

A proof of concept (POC) is a demonstration, the purpose of which is to verify that certain concepts or theories 
have the potential for real-world application. 
POC is therefore a prototype that is designed to determine feasibility, but does not represent deliverables.


@ComponentScan(basePackages = {"com.jsp.ApplicationContextAlpha","com.jsp.ApplicationContextAlpha1"})

 which is used to specifying the location of POJO classes to the  IoC container by using basePackages attribute

note: here if we have n number of packages so it is to complex to search to write to much code so instead of doing that  we use same domain (common prefix name) name as package 
so it try to create object of all domain com.jsp packages beans which are annotated with @Component
@ComponentScan(basePackages = {"com.jsp"})
while we using annotation so bean id will  consider as class name. bean id will be as lower name as class name
if we have an multiple word class name so bean id will consider as First word will Lower and remaining Words Initial char will be cap letter
