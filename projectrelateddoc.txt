Brief Description: This was a POC for User Management System. The main objective of this project is to manage
the userâ€™s information. This application is built on n-layered MVC architecture and has various modules like
registration, login, forgot password and update users information. By using this application, users can be able to
register their details, login and they can update the same once they login. This application also generates a
password and mails it to a registered email by using JavaMails. User can upload the files using this application.

A proof of concept (POC) is a demonstration, the purpose of which is to verify that certain concepts or theories 
have the potential for real-world application. 
POC is therefore a prototype that is designed to determine feasibility, but does not represent deliverables.
